# Codes for coursera course "Bayesian Statistics Time Series Analysis" from UCSC

### Week 2
Perform maximum likelihood estimation on AR coefficients and variance assuming a AR(8) process on a portion of time series data (an electroencephalogram 
recorded in a particular location on the scalp of an individual). Generate 500 samples to approximate the posterior distribution of the parameters. Calculate 
the corresponding reciprocal roots with the posterior mean.
